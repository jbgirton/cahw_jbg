Cabled Array HackWeek notes

sign up on Slack, Github, etc
projects: HPIES, 
organizers: Rob Fatland, Deb Kelley, Aaron Marburg, Wu-Jung Lee
goals: cloud computing, OOI data, programming tools (python), also how
do I get AMPS data with automated scripts?

HPIES project...want to know whether it works... compare P to
barotropic tide model (TPXO); compare IES TT to internal tide model
(Zhao) and/or 

Jupyter notebooks:
cahwhub.cloudmaven.org
shift-enter runs code
-->interactive tool on Jupyter (at Amazon?)...create plots and test out
code in web browser (chrome)

OOI cabled array (Kelley):
- winched profiler has been working well. lots of profiles! (but what
are they good for?)
- NSF Geo has a high success rate now (78%?) must be for geo-only
projects
- coastal currents, shelf-basin exchange, nutrients/oxygen/pH
- what about coastal canyons, sediment flows, slope erosion by
internal waves, conduits for ocean property exchange and 
- Axial caldera: Deb's main interest is volcanic eruptions and
hydrothermal vents. 
- The Future: lots of tsunami/earthquake operational warning systems
proposed/planned around the world.

Data talk (Mike Vardaro):
help@oceanobservatories.org
http://oceanobservatories.org
data are telemetered, recovered, streamed, shipboard, or metadata
levels raw, L0, L1, L2
Miyamoto asks about timestamps: most things are GPS referenced, but
some instruments have internal clocks...how are these referenced
later?

Challenges: integrating data streams... satellite SST, SSH; Argo
profiles, model output (HYCOM, LiveOcean).

Python/Jupyter session:
yellow/green notes indicate
help/ok or science/methods
jupyter hub...
Try to learn: esc-A, esc-B, write text, write latex format, 
Good for sharing
- If not working on github, try nbviewer to get graphic rendering.
- building stuff on swcarpentry
- scikit is a machine learning package (popular)
